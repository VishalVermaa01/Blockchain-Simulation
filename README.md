# Blockchain-Simulation
This project is a simulation of a basic blockchain system, demonstrating the core concepts of blockchain technology such as blocks, hashing, proof-of-work, and chain validation. It includes functionalities for creating blocks, mining them using a proof-of-work algorithm, and verifying the integrity of the blockchain built with Python.
